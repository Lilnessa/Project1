# Project1

Project by Vanessa Dumlao, Shruti Palur Mallampalli, and Noelle Watson

## Overview
The Project 1 Repository consists of data pertaining to gas prices in San Diego. The project explores gas prices in San Diego to see how factors such as zip code, household income, and population density affect these prices. 

The repository contains the Resource folder, which contains two csv files that hold all of the source data. Also in the Resource folder are two csv files which were created using the gas_price_zip_code.ipynb file. 

Outside of the Resource folder are two Jupyter Notebook files, the gas_price_zip_code.ipynb script, and the charts.ipynb script. The gas_price_zip_code.ipynb takes the source data from two csv files and combines them according to zip code, and outputs the Zip Code All Data.csv file. The script also outputs the extra_clean_gas.csv which has the cleaned data from the gas-prices-10-04.csv file. The charts.ipynb script takes the outputted csv files analyzes the data, and produces various charts.

The data used in Project 1 comes from two different sources. The second set of data, which can be found in gas-prices-10-04.csv, was generated by Gas Prices Scaper, an api that collects that dayâ€™s current gas prices at every gas station whose prices are listed on google maps within the search parameters. The area in which data was collected for, was determined by the zip codes that were available in
